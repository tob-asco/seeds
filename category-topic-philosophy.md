# Should :question::question::question: Be a Category/Topic, Or Not?
## Categories
- A category lives or dies with its associated topics
  - if it gives rise to sufficiently many *good* topics, it lives
  - because there is no need for a category w/o any (good) topics

So what is a *good* topic?
## Topics
A (good) topic should do the following two jobs:
### 1. :cool: Interesting
- *By itself*, the topic should spark interest in the users that are browsing.
- This demands a certain concreteness.
- We want a topic to be polarizing, as much as possible (while obeying (2.)).
- Examples:
  - :no_entry: `GAD: electrical` ... boring! There exists no community for electrical gadgets.
  - :cool: `GAD: non-electrical` ... totally different story; Building gadgets w/o electrical supply demands much more creativity (like *da Vinci*) and usually comes with some elegance 
  - :no_entry: `LIT: long`
  - :cool: `LIT: short` ... short stories are a separate branch of literature, while there exist no "long stories"
- *If a topic more-or-less defines the interests of an existing community, probably (1.) is met.*
### 2. :abacus: Categorification
- *By itself*, the topic should be a tiny category, i.e. not too specialized.
  It should cover fair amount of its parent category.
- This avoids too much concreteness.
- Reason is to avoid too many topics ...
  - ... per Idea
  - ... per Category
  - ... in total.
